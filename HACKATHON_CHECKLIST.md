## 🎤 Presentation Preparation

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
```
"FoodSense AI+ solves food label confusion through AI that thinks for you. 
No forms, no profiles – just show the food. 
The AI infers what you care about, explains it in 3 simple insights, 
and admits when research is uncertain. 
It's AI-native, patent-pending, and user-friendly."
```

### Key Talking Points
- [ ] Problem: 20+ ingredient confusion
- [ ] Solution: AI-native co-pilot
- [ ] Innovation: Intent inference (no config)
- [ ] Patent: 6 novel claims
- [ ] Impact: Reduces cognitive load
- [ ] Demo: Live working prototype

### Q&A Preparation
**Common Questions**:

1. **"How is this different from existing apps?"**
   - "Most apps are databases with AI added. We're AI-first – intent inference without setup."

2. **"Can this scale?"**
   - "Absolutely. Modular architecture, swap AI models, add databases, proven tech stack."

3. **"What about accuracy?"**
   - "We prioritize honesty over perfection. Confidence bars and uncertainty notes build trust."

4. **"Is this patentable?"**
   - "Yes. Six claims: intent inference, fixed-output reasoning, uncertainty signals, ELI5, timeline, comparison."

5. **"Next steps?"**
   - "Integrate OpenFoodFacts DB, add OCR, mobile apps, user accounts, A/B test UI."
