## 📝 Alternative: Live Demo Script

If doing a live demo instead of video:

### Introduction (30s)
"Hi judges! I'm [Name], and this is FoodSense AI Plus. We've all been there: standing in the grocery store, staring at an ingredient list, completely confused. Is this healthy? Safe? Should I buy it? Let me show you how AI can solve this."

### Demo (60s)
[Perform same steps as video]

### Innovation Highlight (20s)
"What makes this special? Three things: First, the AI infers your intent automatically—no setup. Second, we communicate uncertainty honestly—judges love transparency. Third, we've added innovations like voice input and impact timelines."

### Wrap-up (10s)
"This is AI-native design. This is FoodSense AI Plus. Thank you!"

## 🎯 Key Messaging Points

**Must Mention**:
- ✅ AI-native (not AI-added)
- ✅ Intent inference (no forms)
- ✅ Cognitive load reduction (3 insights)
- ✅ Honest uncertainty
- ✅ ELI5 accessibility
- ✅ Patent-worthy innovations

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Saying "we used GPT-4" (focus on experience, not tech)
- ❌ Over-explaining implementation details
- ❌ Comparing to competitors
- ❌ Mentioning limitations

## 📊 Judging Criteria Alignment

| Criterion | How We Address | Demo Timestamp |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AI-Native Experience (50%) | Intent inference, AI-generated follow-ups | 0:30 - 1:00 |
| Reasoning & Explanation (30%) | 3 insights, confidence bars, trade-offs | 1:00 - 1:20 |
| Technical Execution (20%) | Clean UI, working prototype, innovations | 1:20 - 1:50 |

## 🚀 Post-Demo Q&A Preparation

**Expected Questions**:

**Q**: "How accurate is your ingredient data?"  
**A**: "We prioritized experience over completeness. Our MVP has 15 well-researched ingredients with research citations. Production would integrate comprehensive databases."

**Q**: "Can this scale?"  
**A**: "Absolutely. The AI pipeline is modular—we can swap OpenAI for open-source models. Backend is FastAPI (production-ready). Frontend deploys to Vercel."

**Q**: "What about allergies?"  
**A**: "Great question! The intent inference engine already detects concern patterns. Adding allergen-specific intent (peanut, gluten, etc.) is a straightforward extension."

**Q**: "Is this patentable?"  
**A**: "Yes. Our patent abstract identifies 6 novel claims: intent inference without config, fixed-output reasoning, uncertainty-aware signals, adaptive explanation, temporal projection, and comparative analysis."

## ✅ Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Backend running (test `/api/health`)
- [ ] Frontend running (test demo products)
- [ ] Demo products loaded and tested
- [ ] ELI5 mode working
- [ ] Screen recording software tested
- [ ] Microphone audio quality verified
- [ ] Script practiced 3+ times
- [ ] Backup plan if live demo fails (video recording)

## 🎬 Final Notes

**Duration Control**: If running over 2 minutes, cut:
1. Voice input showcase (can mention verbally)
2. Product comparison (can mention verbally)
3. Extended ELI5 demo (show quickly)

**If Running Under**: Add:
- Brief code walkthrough
- Mention patent-pending status
- Show GitHub stars/activity

**Energy Level**: High! Enthusiasm wins hackathons.
